True and False are the values of boolean datatype.While writing these values with T and F in uppercase
The three boolean operators are AND, OR, NOT.
The list of boolean operator truth tables {True and true = true, False and True = False, False and true = False, False and False = False}, {True or True = True, True or False = True, False or True = True, False or False = False} and{not True - False, not False = True}
False, False, True, False, False, True
The six comparison operators are ==,>=,<=,!=,<,>
equal to == is used to compare two values but assignment operator is used to give or assign a value to the variable. We use assignment operator in program to store a value.
The three blocks are one if spam==10: print('eggs'), second is if spam>5: print('bacon') and third is else print('ham') print('spam') print('spam')
if spam==1:  print(Hello)    elif spam==2:  print(Howdy)    else:   print(Greetings!)
if the program is stuck in endless loop, we copy the program using ctrl+c and paste in a new cell using ctrl+v and rearrange the code.
break statement immediately breaks the loop and goes to next line but continue will redirect to the loop until the code is false.
